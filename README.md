# Smurf
My SmurfViewer

Smurfs met for the first time SwiftUI.

Here you can always be update on who they are and what they do! 

I choosed to use SwiftUI because it is the framework which I have worked most during the last year at Apple Academy.
It was funny to create the project from zero but following the UIKit one. I hope that enjoyed it!
